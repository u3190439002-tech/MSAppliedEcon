# MS Applied Econ @UOL (Universitaet Oldenburg)

This is the central code-base of whatever i have personally learnt at my time in University of Oldenburg, Germany.

Even though my course is a Master's in Applied Economics I want to learn more Linux, Open-Source software and eventually end up in a DevOps role.

Hopefully i learn a lot and enjoy even more!
Cheers!
