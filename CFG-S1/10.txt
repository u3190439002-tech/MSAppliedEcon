(00:00) coffee break german lesson 10. [Music] herzl coming to coffee break
german ich heisenmark my name is thomas and we are delighted to be back with
you once again with another lesson of coffee break german in which we'll be
helping you or indeed thomas will be helping me learn some german vegets hoyte
thomas stir well just before we started this lesson you taught me a new word
and that is i'm tired [Music] ah that's okay mark i hope it's going to be an
easy lesson we're doing lots of review today and go through all the things we
learned in the

(00:50) last lessons okay so this will hopefully be a good review for all of
our listeners and by the end of this lesson hopefully you'll realize just how
much you've learned shall we get started yeah last one's unfounded off gates
mark [Music] so as we said we are going to begin with a little review from last
time thomas last time we were looking at languages and i think you've got some
phrases for me to translate into german i'll give you a few english phrases and
we'll see if our listeners can translate them okay i understand a little german

(01:34) but i don't speak any german okay so we'll give our listener some time
to think this through let's hear it one more time i understand a little german
but i don't speak any german okay so i understand a little german would that be
ich firster ambition deutsch yeah good but i don't understand i don't i don't
speak any german deutsch ah say good yeah you realize the kind yeah so there's
not any becomes kind because we're talking about not any german kain deutsch
okay so that was number one deutsch you will understand a little spanish and

(02:33) you also understand a little french okay so just to double check you're
saying you is that the do or the z form let's go with a formal c version this
time so let's have the phrase again for number two you understand a little
spanish and you also understand the little french okay so over to the listeners
so you understand a little spanish that would be i think the first day in
ambition spanish and you also understand a little french would that be [Music]
almost correct what was wrong with that one [Music]

(03:48) [Music] you understand some japanese but you don't speak spanish and do
you want the do or the z form let this time we go with the do the informal
version okay there's one slight problem here i don't think we've done yet the
do form for for stain to understand how do you say you understand informally go
fish taste do fish taste dual fish taste so following our verb lesson that our
grammar guru gave us last week we can work out that we put the st ending on
there okay so you want you understand some japanese but you

(04:45) speak no spanish or you don't speak spanish yeah and some japanese is
the same as a little you can use the same german word okay one last time then
is you understand a little japanese but you speak no spanish so you understand
a little japanese taste but you don't speak spanish spanish say good perfect
just remember in german it makes no difference if you say you don't speak any
spanish you speak no spanish you don't speak spanish in german it's always
douchebag spanish okay so for once german is more simple than english yes

(05:44) okay i think we'll move on now and we're going to use lots of the
language that we've learned in the past 10 lessons in a conversation and this
conversation is going to be taking place in a restaurant so i'll take the role
of michael uh an american i'm not going to put on an american accent and i'm
friedrich and you're going to find out where i come from okay so we'll see the
conversation right the way through from the beginning and we'll actually see
this whole conversation twice and then we'll talk about some of the

(06:14) phrases because there's some new things in here too as well as lots of
review of phrases that we've previously learned the house deutschland [Music]
[Music] spanish

(08:48) so hopefully in that conversation you understood quite a bit there were
definitely some new phrases which we'll go through later but let's listen to
the whole conversation again and this time we'll do it a little more quickly a
little more at normal speed hello [Music]

(10:44) foreign okay we're going to pick up on some of the phrases in this
conversation particularly the new phrases that we've not heard before thomas
you said or friedrich said he'd been in salzburg yeah it means i was born in
salzburg so presumably we can replace salzburg with any other town so i could
say for example ich bin in edinburgh yeah or you can also replace it with the
country you say ich bin in deutschland born okay frederick also said since
which means are you here the first time okay so is is this your first time here

(11:32) for example yeah okay so we've had mal as in nokai mal again so it's
like the time are you literally are you for the first time here yeah that's
correct sent si tsum estan mal here okay friedrich asked michael if he was
staying alone or is he here in munich with his family let's hear that whole
phrasebonanzi alaine order since here with yes in english you would probably
see are you living by yourself and then the part which talks about your family
listen again to how friedrich asked are you here with your family

(12:24) media family let's just hear again your family familia so that word era
in this case it means you're so your family met ira familia it's a word that
we're going to come across in a number of different forms depending on the
context in which it's used don't worry too much about that just now i know this
because we had a long conversation about cases and things like that before we
started recording this lesson but don't worry about it we'll get back to that
another time okay another nice phrase that was used in this conversation is
when friedrich told

(13:08) michael you speak perfect german have a listen to this see perfect so
it's nice to make a compliment like this about someone's language and it's very
nice to receive that compliment so hopefully lots of people will say to you
these prachen perfectus deutsch and of course you can remind them well i i've
been listening to coffee break german it's an excellent language course
coffeebreakgerman.

(13:35) com and so on now another thing that thomas or friedrich said was i
wish my english was as good as your german listen to this phrase now if we were
to go into the grammar of this i just don't understand how this phrase works
but if we learn it as a phrase in itself as a piece of vocabulary then it's a
really nice expression and of course i can turn it around and say i wish my
german was as good as your english so would i say english and just as we've
changed the languages in in this expression can we also change the language in
the ich bergen perfect

(14:28) storage yes that's right all the languages have the same gender you so
you can just exchange them you can say for example perfect is english see
perfect spanish okay excellent now there was one other phrase that i'd like to
pick up on from that uh conversation and that is the phrase that you used it
sounded like um as freud me but it was slightly different and i think it was
used at the end of the conversation when we were saying goodbye so what was the
phrase ah we mentioned s hat makes sega floyd so am i guessing correctly that
this

(15:06) means it was nice to meet you or it has been nice to meet you it was a
pleasure to meet you it's had me saying freud another phrase we heard at the
end was fieldlike here in deutschland so fake look just means good luck which
is a very nice phrase if you say goodbye to somebody or okay so let's hear that
again feel look fill click field look okay that makes me think that there are a
few other phrases that we really ought to cover in this first group of ten
lessons um how would you say for example happy birthday

(15:44) we would say al escote some giveaway oh it's a little more complicated
than happy birthday let's try that again that's what means all the best for
your birthday and the boots tag is that linked to um in salzburg yeah
translated it's the day when i was born the day of my birth okay so gabriel's
tag yeah okay i'll escort it to bootstuck and while we're at it happy christmas
[Music] and happy new year for always or means new so good new year four is
noise and do you never see year you wouldn't say noise yeah but you can

(16:47) say good noise yeah okay and one final phrase i'm thinking of phrases
that people always like to learn when they're learning a foreign language uh a
bit of a strange one here but how do you say i love you liberty and i'm
guessing that we're using the do form here presumably if people are saying i
love you they already know each other quite well yep okay now since we're
talking about different times of the year this lesson is going out around
easter so let's hear from yulia about how easter is celebrated in the german
speaking parts of the world

(17:24) over to you julia hello mark chris scott thomas and my mind and today i
will tell you about the german way of celebrating easter as in so many other
countries as well here in germany people eat and give each other colorful
easter eggs on easter sunday you can buy them already painted but many families
paint the eggs themselves together this tradition is especially enjoyed by
children and of course what they love even more is aya on easter sunday which
means searching for the eggs and other little presents that their parents hide
for them

(18:07) did i just say parents well of course the ustahaza easter bunny is the
one hiding the axe here mostly in the garden or in the park and if there is
this typical weather at this time of year with a mix of rain sun hail and even
snow sometimes the easter presents might also be found behind the couch or in
the lampshade on easter sunday then as soon as you've found the eggs there is
this funny tradition of aya rollin rolling axe downhill the rules for this game
might differ from region to region but it is mostly the egg rolling the
furthest that wins

(18:46) next to looking for little gifts thereare some other traditions as well
obviously easter is the most important christian holiday which means that many
people throughout germany switzerland and austria attend mars on easter sunday
the night before on saturday it is common to light the so-called usta foia
easter fires which are bonfires traditionally led to drive away evil spirits of
course there aren't any traditional celebrations without typical traditional
food it's very common to only eat fish on good friday khao freitag of deutsche

(19:23) and on sunday the traditional dish is lamb roast as well as easter
bread which is more like a cake than bread and it's baked with yeast nuts and
raisins the easter weekend is a long one for german and swiss people as they
have both the kal-freitag good friday and oster montag easter monday off work
whereas austrians only have easter monday off as usual i hope you've enjoyed
this little cultural insight into some traditions that we celebrate here in
german-speaking parts of the world i'll hand you back to mark and thomas in the

(20:03) studio miss belt okay danke julia now over these past 10 lessons i
really feel as if i've learned lots and i hope you do too i was really pleased
to be able to take part in that long conversation putting together all the
words and phrases that we've learned and of course throwing in a few new
phrases also now each week we've been joined by kirsten our grammar guru and
we're going to go back to kirsten now i hope you've not got lots more
complicated grammar for us today kristin well mark is right we certainly have

(20:36) covered a lot in the last few lessons today since you're a bit tired
mark i'm not going to be teaching you anything new but i'll be going over some
of the things that you've already learned one of the first things we learned
about german is that all nouns whether they are animate nouns like people or
inanimate like objects have grammatical gender which is indicated by its
article we learnt three definite articles they are for masculine nouns d for
feminine and das for neutrinos we also learned how to talk about

(21:12) definite articles in terms of their case and can say that the articles
de d and das are the nominative case forms the ones you would find in the
dictionary and use when the noun is the subject of the sentence then we learnt
about the changes that take place if the noun becomes the object of a sentence
or if it comes after a preposition like uber this puts them into the accusative
case that meant that da changed to dane but the other two stayed the same we
also talked about how adjectives in german change their endings to fit the

(21:51) gender of the noun they're describing remember guten morgen guten abend
but oh and don't forget that when you're writing nouns always start with a
capital letter moving on from nouns we also talked about verbs firstly we
learned that in a simple sentence the verb always comes in second position but
remember it's not always the second word so we had ich komme aus deutschland
abba yeste then we learned that after a modal verb like kunin the main verb
goes to the end of the sentence like in kuninzi mia bitte de rechnombren

(22:37) last time we learnt the conjugation patterns for the singular forms of
verbs we took the en off the infinitive and replaced it with the singular verb
endings e for e s t for do e n for z and t for air z and s which gave us ich
kame ducomst z common and then a c and s compt and remember do and c are two of
the different ways to say you the first one for someone you know and the second
one for someone you don't wow that was a lot don't worry if you haven't fully
grasped some of those grammar points quite yet the more you use them the easier
it'll

(23:25) get and eventually it'll all become automatic but in the meantime you
can head over to the coffee break german website for more information and
helpful hints about language learning well done for getting this far in the
course i'm really looking forward to joining you again soon for more coffee
break german grammar guru [Music] so it's been a bit of a longer lesson today
but hopefully you've enjoyed using the phrases the words and phrases that
you've been learning over the past 10 lessons of coffee break german and

(24:11) hearing them within the context of the conversation hopefully you enjoy
these little bonus phrases as we did at the end and if you now ever come across
the german you really like you're now able to say it excellent don't forget
that you can find out lots more about coffee break german at our website which
we've already mentioned on this show coffeebreakgerman.
